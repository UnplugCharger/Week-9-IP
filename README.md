# Naive Bayes Classifier in Python


In machine learning, Naïve Bayes classification is a straightforward and powerful algorithm for the classification task. In this kernel, I implement Naive Bayes Classification algorithm with Python and Scikit-Learn. I build a Naive Bayes Classifier to predict whether an email is spam or not

There are 3 types of Naïve Bayes algorithm. The 3 types are listed below:-

Gaussian Naïve Bayes

Multinomial Naïve Bayes

Bernoulli Naïve Bayes

These 3 types of algorithm are explained below.


# kNN Classifier Tutorial in Python


kNN or k-Nearest Neighbours Classifier is a very simple and easy to understand machine learning algorithm. In this kernel, I build a k Nearest Neighbours classifier to classify wether a passanger survived or not in the titanic dataset
